# Hridaya - Cardiovascular Disease Detection Model

"Hridaya" is a machine learning model designed to predict cardiovascular disease by analyzing clinical data with advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and k-fold cross-validation. It achieves high performance, with a recall of 94% and an accuracy of 91%, demonstrating the model's robustness in identifying patterns within the data. A strong focus was placed on improving both accuracy and recall, as minimizing false negatives is critical in disease prediction.

The project culminates in a user-friendly web application, making the model accessible to healthcare practitioners. Using the pickle module and the Streamlit framework, the model is seamlessly deployed for practical use.
